If the array is sorted, we could use binary search as a more efficient alternative to linear search. The algorithm involves finding a "midpoint" in the dataset and then checking whether the value at that pointis less than or greater than the target value. If it is greater than the value, we repeat the process on the first half of the data set, whereas if it is less than the value we repeat the process on the second half. This splitting continues until the data is reduced to only one element- which should be the value being searched for. This algorithm would have a runtime of O(logn), since the number of operations is equal to the number of times the algorithm can split the data set into two (log2(n)).
